<h1>Editing article</h1>
<div style="color: red; font-size: large">This form is set up to use unpoly autosubmit. In firefox (and chrome) it should autosubmit while text is changed without losing focus on change. In safari, it refreshes the page instead, loses focus and prevents further input.</div>
<div style="color: red;">In safari, if you manually refresh the page or otherwise load this page directly without going through the "create" workflow, autosubmit begins working properly.</div>
<%= render "edit_form", article: @article %>
